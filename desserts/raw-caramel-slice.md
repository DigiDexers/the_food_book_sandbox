# Raw Caramel Slice

These rich, sweet-salty, chewy chunks of gluten-free goodness take a few steps but are _very_ satisfying when completed. The only problem is stopping at one piece!

## Ingredients

### Notes

* The below creates enough slice for ten serves.

### For the base \(the 'biscuit' part\)

* 3/4 cup raw almonds
* 1/3 cup desiccated or shredded coconut
* 6 medjool dates, pitted
* 1/4 cup melted coconut oil

### For the middle bit \(the caramel part\)

* 12 medjool dates, pitted
* 1/3 cup almond butter
* 2 tablespoons of rice malt syrup or maple syrup
* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
* 1/4 teaspoon salt

### For the topping \(the chocolate part\)

* 1/3 cup of raw cacao or cocoa powder
* 1/4 cup of coconut oil, melted
* 1/2 cup of rice malt syrup or maple syrup

## Method

### Notes

* This caramel slice needs to be served chilled. If you prefer a harder set, keep it in the freezer until ready to serve.

### Step one

To make the almond base, line a 20cm square slice tin with non-stick baking paper. Place the almonds, coconut, dates and oil in a food processor. Process for 1–2 minutes or until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Using the back of a spoon, press the mixture into the base of the tin and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until set. 

### Step two

To make the date caramel, place the dates, almond butter, maple syrup, vanilla and salt in the cleaned food processor and process for 1–2 minutes or until smooth. Spread over the base and refrigerate until needed. 

### Step three

Place the cacao, oil and rice malt syrup in a medium heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water \(the bowl shouldn’t touch the water\) and stir for 2–3 minutes or until smooth. Pour the cacao mixture over the caramel and refrigerate for 2 hours. Freeze for 30 minutes or until set. 

### Step four

Remove from the tin and cut into bars to serve.
