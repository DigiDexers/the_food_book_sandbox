# Notes

I added a new page by clicking on the plus sign \(+\) next to 'New' in the menu on the left.

I just tested the 'create a pdf' function \(top right corner\) which allowed me to easily create and download a pdf of Sara's pavlova recipe, which I can now print out to add to my personal recipe collection.
