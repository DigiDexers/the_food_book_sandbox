# Pavlova

### Ingredients

* 4 egg whites
* 1 ¼ cups white sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 teaspoon lemon juice
* 2 teaspoons cornflour
* 1 pint double cream
* 4 kiwi, peeled and sliced
* 1 banana, sliced
* 10 strawberries, sliced

### Method

* Preheat oven to 150 degrees C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Draw a 22cm circle on the baking paper.
* In a large bowl, beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gradually add in the sugar, about 1 tablespoon at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat until thick and glossy. Gently fold in vanilla extract, lemon juice, and cornflour.
* Spoon mixture inside the circle drawn on the parchment paper. Working from the centre, spread mixture toward the outside edge, building edge slightly. This should leave a slight depression in the centre.
* Bake for 1 hour. Cool on a wire rack.
* In a small bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form; set aside. Remove the paper, and place meringue on a flat serving plate. Fill the centre of the meringue with whipped cream, and top with kiwifruit slices, banana slices and sliced strawberries.

### Cook's notes

If you let the pavlova cool in the oven it is less likely to crack.
